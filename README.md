## Disclaimer
All service calls responsible for handling payment information should use best-in-class security practices. This software is intended for **TEST** / **DEVELOPMENT** purposes **ONLY** and is not intended to be used in a production environment. This app will only work with **TEST** merchant IDs (ie. merchant IDs that begin with `TEST`) and should only serve to satisfy the following use cases:
